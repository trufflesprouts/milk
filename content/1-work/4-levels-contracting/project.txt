    The branding of Levels Contracting Est.
    was crucial due to its diverse
    industrial operations in Saudi Arabia.
    What makes this identity unique is its
    minimal charm in being subtle yet
    impactful simultaneously. The strategic
    cutoff on the main letter, symbolizing
    levels of progress, in relation to the
    two tactical slashes with its
    contrasting colors represent the endless
    possibilities that this company has to
    offer with its team of multinational
    engineers and architects.

    Due to the complexity behind
    contracting, the audience needed to
    interact with the brand quickly. Levels
    needed to be easily recognizable. The
    colors used automatically require the
    viewers to be alert of the projects. An
    entire space covered in copious amounts
    of black and yellow raises curiosity and
    will expand their clientele. Levels also
    has an emotional connection with its
    audience because of its local presence.
    People witnessing their neighbourhoods
    improving will make them respect the
    brand.

    ##Research Abstract
    The type of research started with architectural techniques and geometrical balance. The main research objective was to go through books and articles relating to contracting and the scale of space. This again led to the minimal L cutoff speaking volumes to what Levels is. Our data collection showed that less is more and using space wisely will get the job done. This is clearly shown in the relationship between black and yellow. The result was a bold straightforward approach that is persuasive.

    ##Challenges
    The hardest part of this design was to appeal to an international and local level at the same time. In Saudi Arabia, this minimal approach in English might not be as convincing to all fields such as government projects. In order to overcome this problem, we realized that everyone responds to color. Large spaces of contrasting colors with a bold icon will get anyone talking and asking questions. This technique was a success and Levels has a eclectic clientele due to its brand positioning.
